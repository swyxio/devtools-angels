- David Mytton - [site](https://davidmytton.blog), [twitter](https://twitter.com/davidmytton), [podcast](https://podcast.console.dev), [email](mailto:david@console.dev)
  > I'm co-founder of [Console](https://console.dev), a place for developers to find the best tools. I invest around $25k in early stage devtools / devops / cloud related startups and can help specifically with getting your first users/customers, and with hiring engineers. From 2009-2018, I was CEO at Server Density, a SaaS infrastructure monitoring startup acquired by StackPath, a US-based edge computing business. I am a researcher in sustainable computing at Uptime Institute and affiliated with Imperial College London. I'm also an EIR at Seedcamp.

  > I founded/sold Codeship and write angel + scout fund checks ($5-25K) in data or dev tool startups. First check or seed/A preferred. I don't care who else invests and geo is irrelevant as long as it's a reasonable legal entity. I can help best with everything product, go2market, company strategy, fundraising, and ceo/exec coaching. DM on Twitter is best for reaching out.

- Max Stoiber - [site](https://mxstbr.com/investing/)

  > I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game — I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.
  
- Michael Grinich - [DM](https://twitter.com/grinich/status/1357103620613840898?s=20)

  > I’m a technologist. I studied CS at MIT and still write code. When I invest, I specifically look for technical founders building dev tools, API platforms, and “unloved” workflow cloud SaaS. I founded both Nylas and WorkOS and worked at Dropbox so this is an area I know well. My typical check size is around $100k but I can flex and get creative for bigger rounds too. If I invest, I will offer introductions to other investors I know (and like). This can help fill out a larger round. [more here](https://twitter.com/grinich/status/1357103610421673984?s=20)
